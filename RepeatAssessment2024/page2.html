            <h3>What are the four learning styles?</h3>
            <p>The notion that everyone has their own learning style became popular in the 1970s.
                 It's an attractive thought: if each of us could identify one, "ideal" approach to learning,
                  we'd be able to focus on it – and be consistently successful.</p>

            <p>What's more, by understanding other people's needs, we'd know how best to support them to learn.
                It could revolutionize education, training and L&D, and help all of us to reach our full potential as learners.</p>

            <h5>The four core learning styles include visual, auditory, reading and writing, and kinesthetic.
                 Here’s an overview of all four learning style types.</h5>

            <h3>Visual</h3>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p id="p1"> Visual - Visual learners are better able to retain information when it’s presented to them in a graphic depiction, such as arrows, charts, diagrams, symbols, and more.
         Similar to how designers use visual hierarchy to emphasize specific design elements, visual learners thrive with clear pictures of information hierarchy</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Auditory</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Auditory - Sometimes referred to as “aural” learners, auditory learners prefer listening to information that is presented to them vocally.
         These learners work well in group settings where vocal collaboration is present and may enjoy reading aloud to themselves, too.</p>
<hr>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
             <h3>Reading and Writing</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Reading & Writing - Focusing on the written word, reading and writing learners succeed with written information on worksheets, presentations, and other text-heavy resources.
         These learners are note-takers and perform strongly when they can reference written text.</p>
<hr>
    <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-4">
             <h3>Kinesthetic</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Kinesthetic - Taking a physically active role, kinesthetic learners are hands-on and thrive when engaging all of their senses during course work.
         These learners tend to work well in scientific studies due to the hands-on lab component of the course.</p>

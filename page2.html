            <h3>What are learning styles?</h3>
            <p>The most important thing to know before studying or daily learning is that everyone learns in different ways and knowing
                what your preferred learning style is going to massively boost your capability to learn and help you remember what you revise</p>

		 <p>This page is going to go over the different learning styles and how to put them into practice.</p>

		 <h5>The four core learning styles are visual, auditory, reading and writing, and kinesthetic.
                 Hereâ€™s an overview of all four learning style types.</h5>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Visual</h3>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p> Visual learners find learning easier through the use of visual aids such as examples your teacher would draw up on the board,
         or their own visual aids such as flowcharts or diagrams. These visual aids help retain the information for longer and revise
          easily so if you think this might appeal to your learning style, give it a shot! </p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Auditory</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Auditory learners need to hear topics they're learning vocally through their teachers, they also may benefit from discussing the topic with fellow students.
        Auditory learners wont exactly learn from taking down notes or using diagrams and flowcharts, but it could still be beneficial to do so and then
        read it back to yourself again and again.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
             <h3>Reading and Writing</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Reading and Writing learners are the people that benefit most from taking down notes. everything covered in class that they note down is already retained,
        and when they revise it later, their understanding only gets stronger. Highlighters are their best friend as they will highlight the most important notes for them to revise.</p>

    <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-4">
             <h3>Kinesthetic</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Kinesthetic learners truly learn when putting the topic they're learning into action. They benefit from the likes of exam questions and in class work as they learn 
        best getting to use their topic practically.</p>
